## How users can get started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (LTS version recommended)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js) or [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/soumyabratasarkar/portfolio.git
    cd portfolio
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    Or using Yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

### Running the Project Locally

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server:

Using npm:
```bash
npm start
```
Or using Yarn:
```bash
yarn start
```

This will open the application in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`. The page will reload if you make edits.

### Building for Production

To create a production-ready build of the application, which is suitable for deployment on a static web host like Hostinger:

Using npm:
```bash
npm run build
```
Or using Yarn:
```bash
yarn build
```

This command builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The `build` folder can then be uploaded to your web hosting solution.
